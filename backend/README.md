# WineCast Project

## Overview
WineCast is a web application designed to assist vineyard owners in managing their crops by providing real-time weather data and actionable insights. The application leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to gather meteorological information and offers suggestions for irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting based on the collected data.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd WineCast_db
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python installed, then run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the database:**
   Create a MySQL database named `WineCast_db` and configure the connection settings in `src/services/db_service.py`.

4. **Run the application:**
   Start the Flask application by executing:
   ```
   python src/app.py
   ```

5. **Access the web interface:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage
- The application will periodically fetch weather data for the specified vineyard location.
- Based on the weather conditions, it will provide suggestions for irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting.
- Users can interact with the application through the web interface to view real-time data and recommendations.

## Testing
To run the unit tests, execute:
```
pytest tests/
```
